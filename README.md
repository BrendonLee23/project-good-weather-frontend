## Weather App ðŸ§¥ 

#### Home Section:

Welcome to the Weather Forecast project! This app was developed to provide accurate and intuitive weather information for any location in the world. Through a user-friendly interface, you can view current weather data, future forecasts, and historical graphs to make informed decisions about your wardrobe and daily activities. Find out whether you need to bring an umbrella or if itâ€™s the right time for a walk outside. Be prepared for any weather condition with our easy-to-use weather forecast app.

#### Technologies Used:

This project leverages modern technologies to provide an efficient and engaging user experience. The frontend is developed in React.js, using Styled Components for styling, providing a clean and responsive look. Integration with the weather API is done through Axios, allowing efficient communication with the backend. The global state of the application is managed by React's Context API, providing efficient data management throughout the application. Additionally, the Day.js library is used for date manipulation and formatting, while the SweetAlert2 package adds visual and interactive notifications in case of errors or confirmations.
